# Get Grounded &#127793;

This app is designed to incorporate your phone into a mindfulness exercise.
<p>There are three different mindfullness exercises. One section promps the user to take photos of objects of a certain color that is randomly selected.
This brings the user more awareness to their surroundings. Another section asks users to name 5 things they can see, 4 they can touch, 3 they can touch, 2 they can smell,
and 1 they can taste, and then document them in a form. This again helps ground the user by bringing more awareness to their surroundings and also to their own body.
The third section is a breathing tool, asking the user to follow along with a breathing cycle, synced with phone vibration.</p>
